import React from 'react'

export const SEO = () => {
    return (
        <div>
            Here you can add all the SEO content
            that's not necessarily going to be
            client-side rendering (but you can),
            and it's important for search
            engines like google.

            Currently this component only calls in
            server/routes/renderer.js
        </div>
    )
}
